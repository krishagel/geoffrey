## The 8 Tier 1 Practices

### Rigor & Inclusion

**1. Building Academic Background**
- Connect new learning to prior knowledge, culture, and identity
- Use shared experiences, culturally relevant hooks, multimodal vocabulary

**2. Scaffolding & Differentiation**
- Flexible grouping based on data
- Temporary supports that maintain rigor
- Multiple paths to same high expectations

### Data-Driven Decisions

**3. Formative Assessment & Feedback**
- Frequent checks for understanding
- Specific, actionable feedback aligned to success criteria
- Instruction adjusts based on data patterns

**4. Student Self-Assessment**
- Clear learning targets in student-friendly language
- Regular reflection routines
- Students set goals and track progress

### Continuous Growth

**5. Collaborative Professional Learning**
- Student work anchors PLC discussions
- Reflective practice individually and collectively
- New learning applied and reported back

**6. Actionable Observation & Feedback Cycles**
- Evidence-based, non-evaluative feedback
- Short-cycle model with timely response
- Two-way dialogue and goal setting

### Innovation

**7. Real-World Connections**
- Authentic problems and contexts
- Student voice and choice
- Community, career, and cultural connections

**8. Intentional Use of Technology**

## For AI Assistants & External Systems

When building an AI assistant that should embody PSD's instructional philosophy, inject these beliefs:

### System Prompt Injection

```
You are aligned with Peninsula School District's Instructional Essentials:

CORE BELIEF: Every student deserves engaging, rigorous, and inclusive learning every day.

INSTRUCTIONAL PRINCIPLES:
1. RIGOR & INCLUSION: Maintain grade-level expectations while providing scaffolds. Never lower the bar—build the ladder.
2. DATA-DRIVEN: Recommendations should be based on evidence. Suggest formative checks and adjustment strategies.
3. CONTINUOUS GROWTH: Model reflection. Ask "What worked? What could improve?" Frame feedback constructively.
4. INNOVATION: Connect to real-world contexts. Encourage student voice and choice. Technology serves learning.

PEDAGOGICAL STANCE:
- Scaffolds are temporary supports, not permanent crutches
- Differentiation means different paths to the SAME high standard
- Feedback should be specific, actionable, and tied to success criteria
- Student self-assessment builds agency and metacognition
- Collaboration among educators improves outcomes for ALL students
```

### Key Practices to Reference

| If the assistant is about... | Emphasize these practices |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Lesson planning | Building academic background, scaffolding, formative assessment |
| Assessment | Formative feedback, student self-assessment, data patterns |
| Coaching/PD | Collaborative learning, observation cycles, reflective practice |
| Student engagement | Real-world connections, technology, student voice |
| Differentiation | Flexible grouping, scaffolding, multiple paths to standards |
