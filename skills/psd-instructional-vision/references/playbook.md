## Practice 1: Building Academic Background

**Instructional Essential:** Rigor & Inclusion

**Core Outcome:** All students are able to access grade-level content through intentional connections to prior knowledge, lived experiences, language, and identity.

**Definition:** Building academic background means teachers actively link new learning to what students already know, drawing from their cultural context, lived experiences, and previous learning to create a strong foundation for success with rigorous, grade-level content.

### What This Looks Like in Practice

| Practice | Description | Classroom Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Activate Prior Knowledge Through Shared Experiences** | Launch new learning by engaging students in a shared experience—visual, tactile, or community-based—that creates a common reference point and bridges new content to existing schema. | Before beginning a science unit on erosion, students examine a sand-and-water simulation as a class. This hands-on experience becomes a reference point for vocabulary and later learning. |
| **Integrate Culturally Relevant and Identity-Affirming Hooks** | Intentionally connect new content to students' cultures, languages, or lived experiences to increase engagement and make learning meaningful and inclusive. | In a middle school ELA unit on personal narrative, students first explore oral storytelling traditions from various cultures, including their own, to see themselves in the writing process. |
| **Pre-Teach Academic Vocabulary Using Multimodal Tools** | Explicitly introduce key terms before diving into complex texts or tasks using visuals, gestures, real-world examples, and multilingual support. | In a high school biology class, students use bilingual vocabulary cards, images, and short videos to learn terms like "photosynthesis" and "chloroplast" before reading a dense science text. |

### Indicators of Success
- Students refer to personal or community knowledge during class discussions
- Student work shows increased accuracy and depth due to a strong conceptual foundation
- Academic vocabulary is evident in student talk and writing
- Students demonstrate confidence in participating early in a new unit or complex task

### Educator Reflection Questions
- What cultural, linguistic, or community knowledge do my students bring that connects to this content?
- Which academic vocabulary will be most challenging—and how can I make it stick?
- How can I use a shared experience to create common ground before diving into the unit?

### How Principals Bring This Strategy to Life
- Observe for evidence of background-building during classroom walkthroughs (e.g., Are students referencing known concepts? Is vocabulary supported visually or contextually?)
- Lead PD focused on activating background knowledge and cultural responsiveness (e.g., using student identity maps, integrating real-world hooks)
- Structure PLC time for teams to co-plan scaffolds, shared experiences, and vocabulary routines for upcoming units
- Model strategy use in staff learning (e.g., begin staff PD with identity questions or personal connections to the topic)

### How the District Supports Implementation
- Provide training and exemplars that demonstrate how to build background through inclusive, identity-affirming strategies
- Ensure curriculum adoption and materials include supports for background knowledge building (e.g., visuals, multilingual supports, culturally relevant content)
- Fund professional learning on scaffolding and vocabulary instruction
- Build partnerships with community organizations to bring in speakers, artifacts, or cultural perspectives that enrich content

---

## Practice 2: Scaffolding & Differentiation

**Instructional Essential:** Rigor & Inclusion

**Core Outcome:** All students are challenged and supported to access and engage deeply with grade-level learning through intentional scaffolding and differentiated instruction.

**Definition:** Scaffolding and differentiation involve intentionally designing instruction so that all students—regardless of readiness, language background, or learning needs—can access rigorous content and engage in meaningful learning. Scaffolds are temporary supports; differentiation addresses ongoing learner needs by offering multiple paths to learning.

### What This Looks Like in Practice

| Practice | Description | Classroom Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Use Flexible, Data-Informed Grouping** | Group students based on readiness, language proficiency, interest, or specific skills—and adjust groups frequently based on formative data. This ensures targeted support and promotes equity in participation. | In a 5th-grade math class, students are grouped after a quick check on multi-digit multiplication. Some work on basic strategies with manipulatives, while others apply their skills to multi-step word problems. Groups shift weekly. |
| **Break Down Complex Tasks with Temporary Supports (Scaffolding)** | Make challenging content accessible by breaking it into smaller steps and providing supports like checklists, models, sentence frames, or guided practice—then gradually remove supports as independence grows. | In a high school civics class, students analyze a Supreme Court case. The teacher provides a graphic organizer with sentence stems to help students summarize and critique arguments before transitioning to independent analysis. |
| **Differentiate Content, Process, or Product Based on Student Needs** | Adapt instruction to provide choice or varied levels of support—while maintaining the same high expectations for all students. Differentiation honors learner variability without compromising rigor. | In a middle school science project, all students must explain an ecosystem. One group creates a stop-motion animation, another writes an article, and another builds a physical model with labeled components. |

### Indicators of Success
- Student engagement is high across varying ability levels
- All students complete rigorous tasks with appropriate supports
- Students can articulate what helps them learn or what tools they use
- Groupings and scaffolds are fluid and responsive to learning progress

### Educator Reflection Questions
- What scaffolds can I provide to support access, without reducing the rigor?
- Are my groupings flexible and responsive, or static and fixed?
- How can I provide entry points into this task while keeping the learning target consistent?

### How Principals Bring This Strategy to Life
- Observe for evidence of scaffolding and flexible grouping during walkthroughs (e.g., Do students have different tools or tasks? Are groupings purposeful?)
- Encourage and model differentiation in staff meetings or PD (e.g., using breakout groups based on role, choice-based activities)
- Schedule collaborative time for staff to plan scaffolds together (e.g., common sentence stems, multilingual supports, task breakdowns)
- Provide coaching and feedback focused on ensuring supports are intentional and temporary—not simply reducing task complexity

### How the District Supports Implementation
- Provide professional learning on scaffolding strategies (e.g., gradual release, language supports, tiered questioning)
- Ensure curriculum materials include supports and extensions to differentiate within Tier 1
- Share exemplars and tools (e.g., sample tiered tasks, graphic organizers, digital differentiation platforms)
- Monitor implementation trends and offer coaching support in schools with persistent achievement gaps

## Practice 3: Formative Assessment & Feedback

**Instructional Essential:** Data-Driven Decisions

**Core Outcome:** Educators use timely evidence of student learning to adjust instruction, provide actionable feedback, and support every student's progress toward grade-level outcomes.

**Definition:** Formative assessment is an ongoing process of gathering evidence of learning, providing students with actionable feedback, and adjusting instruction in real time. The goal is to improve student understanding and ensure all learners stay on track to meet grade-level standards.

### What This Looks Like in Practice

| Practice | Description | Classroom Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Embed Frequent Checks for Understanding** | Teachers use quick, low-stakes strategies during instruction to gather evidence of student thinking and identify misconceptions early. | During a 6th-grade lesson on fractions, the teacher uses mini whiteboards for students to solve a problem. Based on responses, the teacher immediately re-teaches to a small group. |
| **Provide Specific, Actionable Feedback** | Feedback is timely, aligned to success criteria, and gives students clear next steps to move their learning forward. | In a high school English class, the teacher provides margin comments on a rough draft like, "Your claim is strong—now revise the evidence to more clearly connect to your thesis." |
| **Adjust Instruction Based on Data Patterns** | Teachers analyze patterns in formative assessments to adjust pacing, groupings, or instructional strategies. | After reviewing exit tickets, a 3rd-grade teacher sees that students are struggling with regrouping in subtraction and plans a hands-on reteach the next day using base-10 blocks. |

### Indicators of Success
- Students can articulate what they are learning and how they know they're making progress
- Feedback given during class is specific, tied to the learning goal, and prompts visible revision or improvement
- Instruction visibly shifts based on student needs (e.g., pacing, grouping, additional supports) within or across lessons
- Student work improves over time in response to feedback, as seen in drafts, performance tasks, or discussions
- Formative checks are embedded throughout instruction—not just at the end of a lesson

### Educator Reflection Questions
- Am I checking for understanding frequently enough during instruction—not just at the end?
- Is my feedback helping students take specific next steps toward success?
- How am I using formative data to adjust instruction for individuals and groups?

### How Principals Bring This Strategy to Life
- Establish a data-informed culture by making formative assessment a routine topic in PLCs, coaching cycles, and leadership team meetings
- Model the use of success criteria and goal-oriented feedback in staff meetings and professional learning
- Observe for evidence of formative assessment in classroom walkthroughs (e.g., Are teachers gathering real-time data and adjusting instruction accordingly?)
- Provide tools and structures for teachers to reflect on formative evidence (e.g., exit ticket analysis protocols, collaborative scoring opportunities)

### How the District Supports Implementation
- Offer professional learning on high-impact formative assessment strategies, feedback practices, and data analysis routines
- Provide tools and technology that support formative data collection and analysis (e.g., student response systems, feedback rubrics, dashboards)
- Support PLC structures with protocols for reviewing student work and using data to plan instruction
- Model the district's commitment to formative feedback by collecting and responding to staff input, showcasing promising practices across schools

## Practice 4: Student Self-Assessment

**Instructional Essential:** Data-Driven Decisions

**Core Outcome:** Students take an active role in their learning by reflecting on their progress, identifying next steps, and using data to make meaningful decisions about how to improve.

**Definition:** Student self-assessment is the process of students evaluating their own learning relative to clear goals and criteria. When students monitor their progress and reflect on their strengths and areas for growth, they become more engaged, metacognitive, and invested in improving.

### What This Looks Like in Practice

| Practice | Description | Classroom Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Use Clear Learning Targets and Success Criteria** | Post and reference learning goals in student-friendly language; co-create or unpack success criteria so students understand what success looks like. | In a 4th-grade writing lesson, the teacher reviews the success criteria for strong introductions, and students highlight examples in their own writing to self-assess. |
| **Incorporate Regular Reflection Routines** | Create structured opportunities for students to reflect on what they've learned and where they need to grow. | In a high school science lab, students complete a reflection log identifying what went well and what they would revise before the next investigation. |
| **Teach Students to Set Goals and Track Progress** | Students identify personal goals, monitor their own growth using tools like rubrics or checklists, and use the information to adjust effort or strategy. | In a middle school math class, students use a mastery tracking chart to color in learning targets they've mastered and set a weekly goal for improvement. |

### Indicators of Success
- Students refer to learning goals and success criteria during work time, independently or with peers
- Student reflections show understanding of their own progress, including both strengths and areas for growth
- Students can articulate how they are improving and what strategies help them learn best
- Students use checklists, rubrics, or progress trackers to make instructional choices (e.g., revising work, asking for support, selecting practice)
- Teachers use student self-assessment data to support goal-setting conferences, grouping decisions, or reteaching priorities

### Educator Reflection Questions
- Do my students understand the learning goals and what success looks like?
- How often do my students reflect on their progress?
- What tools or routines help my students assess their own learning and set goals?

### How Principals Bring This Strategy to Life

## Practice 5: Collaborative Professional Learning

**Instructional Essential:** Continuous Growth

**Core Outcome:** Educators engage in ongoing, collaborative learning that leads to improved instruction, deeper reflection, and increased student achievement.

**Definition:** Collaborative professional learning involves educators working together—regularly and intentionally—to reflect on their practice, analyze student work, and apply new strategies that lead to improved outcomes for all learners. This work is grounded in shared responsibility, data-informed dialogue, and collective efficacy.

### What This Looks Like in Practice

| Practice | Description | Classroom Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Use Student Work as the Anchor** | Teachers collaboratively examine student work or data to identify trends, assess rigor, and align expectations. | In a 2nd-grade PLC, teachers bring writing samples and use a common rubric to calibrate scoring and plan next steps for conferring. |
| **Engage in Reflective Practice** | Teachers reflect on their instructional moves—individually and collectively—to refine practice. | After a co-taught lesson, two 8th-grade teachers debrief using a reflection protocol focused on student engagement and questioning techniques. |
| **Apply New Learning to Practice** | Teachers commit to implementing new strategies learned in PLCs, coaching sessions, or PD—and report back on results. | Teachers commit to implementing new strategies learned in PLCs, coaching sessions, or PD—and report back on results. |

### Indicators of Success
