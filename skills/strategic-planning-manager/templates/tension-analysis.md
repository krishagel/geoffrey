# Organizational Tension Analysis

> Tensions that must be resolved—not just barriers to remove—for the vision to be achieved.

## Understanding Tensions

**Key Distinction:**
- **Barriers** = Obstacles to remove or overcome
- **Tensions** = Conflicts between competing priorities or values that require resolution

Tensions often take the form: "We want X, BUT Y pulls us the opposite direction." Both sides have validity.
