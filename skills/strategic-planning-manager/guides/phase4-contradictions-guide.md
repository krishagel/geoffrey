# Phase 4: Underlying Contradictions
## Facilitator Guide

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Identify deep tensions that must be resolved—not just barriers to overcome—for the vision to be achieved.

**Duration:** 2-3 hours for workshop session

**AI Role:** Pattern identification, framing suggestions
**Human Role:** Primary identification and prioritization

---

## Key Concept: Contradictions vs. Barriers

This is the most commonly misunderstood phase. Clarify early and often:

**Barriers** are obstacles to remove:
- "We don't have enough funding"
- "Our technology is outdated"
- "We lack training in X"

**Contradictions** are tensions to resolve:
- "We want innovation BUT our culture is risk-averse"
- "We value personalization BUT we're measured by standardized tests"
- "We need collaboration BUT staff are siloed and protective"

**The Test:** A contradiction typically has "but" or "vs" in it. Both sides have validity. It's not a problem to solve but a tension to navigate.

- [ ] Category cards (blank)
- [ ] Timer

### Room Setup

- Tables for small groups (4-6 per table)

## Facilitation Script

### Welcome & Concept Teaching (15 min)

**Say:**
"Today we're doing something different—and it might feel uncomfortable. We're identifying the underlying contradictions that could prevent our vision from becoming reality.

These aren't just problems or barriers. They're tensions—places where two things we want pull us in opposite directions.

Let me give you examples..."

**Example 1:**
"We want teachers to take risks and innovate. But we also have a culture that punishes mistakes and values proven practices. That's a contradiction—both things are true, and they create tension."

**Example 2:**
"We want personalized learning for every student. But we're measured by standardized tests that assume everyone learns the same things at the same pace. Contradiction."

**Example 3:**
"We want to be one unified district. But our schools have strong identities and resist central direction. Both are real, both have value, and they're in tension."

**Ask:**
"Does this distinction make sense? A barrier is something to remove. A contradiction is a tension to resolve—often by finding a creative way to honor both sides."

### Individual Brainstorm (15 min)

**Say:**
"Look at our Practical Vision on the wall. For the next 15 minutes, think about what could prevent this vision from becoming real.

But here's the twist—focus on tensions, not just obstacles.

Complete this frame: 'We want _____, BUT _____.'"

**On each sticky note, write one contradiction. Aim for 6-8.**

**Circulate and prompt:**
- "Think about our culture—what tensions exist?"
- "Think about resources—where do we face trade-offs?"
- "Think about stakeholders—where do different groups want different things?"
- "Think about policy—where does external pressure conflict with what we want?"

### Small Group Sharing (20 min)

**Say:**
"At your tables, share your contradictions. Look for similar tensions—combine where appropriate.

As a table, identify your TOP 8-10 contradictions to post.

Write them clearly in the 'We want X, BUT Y' format."

### Wall Posting & Clustering (20 min)

**Say:**
"Post your contradictions on the wall. Then, as a group, cluster similar contradictions together. Work silently first, then discuss."

**Facilitate:**
- "Is this the same tension expressed differently?"
- "Are these related or distinct contradictions?"
- "What's the deeper tension beneath these?"

### Naming Contradictions (25 min)

**Say:**
"Now let's name each cluster. We're giving each contradiction a title that captures the tension.

Not just 'Resources' but 'Innovation vs. Risk Aversion' or 'Centralization vs. School Autonomy'"

**For each cluster, ask:**
- "What's the core tension here?"
- "What are the two sides pulling against each other?"
- "Can we capture this in a short title?"

**Refine language together:**
"We need a name that honors both sides of the tension, not one that implies one side is wrong."

### Prioritization (20 min)

**Say:**
"Not all contradictions are equal. Some are fundamental—if we don't resolve them, nothing else matters. Others are secondary.

Let's prioritize using two criteria:
1. **Impact:** How much does this block our vision?
2. **Tractability:** How much is within our power to address?"

**Dot voting:**
Give each person 3 dots. Vote for the contradictions that are MOST critical to resolve.

**Count and rank:**
- High votes = high priority contradictions
- These will drive strategic direction development

### Impact Mapping (20 min)

**Say:**
"For our top 3-5 contradictions, let's map their impact on our vision.

For each one:
- Which vision categories does it affect?
- How severe is the blockage?
- What happens if we don't resolve it?"

**Create a matrix:**

| Contradiction | Vision Areas Affected | Severity | Cost of Inaction |
|---------------|----------------------|----------|------------------|
| C1 | Learning, Equity | High | Vision fails |
| C2 | Staff, Culture | Medium | Progress slowed |

### Close & Next Steps (10 min)

**Say:**
"This was important work. We've named the tensions that could derail our vision.

Next session: Strategic Directions. We'll design innovative approaches that resolve these contradictions while advancing our vision.

The strategic directions will specifically address these tensions—not avoid them."

## Contradiction Prompts by Category

If groups get stuck, offer these prompts:

**Culture & Mindset:**
- "Where do our stated values conflict with our actual behavior?"
- "What do we say we want but resist when it requires change?"

**Resources & Capacity:**
- "Where do we face trade-offs between competing priorities?"
- "What do we want to do but lack resources for?"

**Structure & Policy:**
- "Where do external requirements conflict with what we believe?"
- "Where does our organizational structure create tension?"

**Stakeholders:**
- "Where do different groups want different things?"
- "Where do adult needs conflict with student needs?"

**Time:**
- "Where do short-term demands conflict with long-term goals?"
- "Where does urgent crowd out important?"

## Common K-12 Contradictions

Use as examples or validation:

| Contradiction | Tension |
|---------------|---------|
| Standardization vs. Personalization | "We want personalized learning BUT we're measured by standardized tests" |
| Innovation vs. Risk Aversion | "We want innovation BUT our culture punishes failure" |
| Collaboration vs. Autonomy | "We want collaboration BUT staff value their independence" |
| Equity vs. Excellence | "We want to serve all students BUT high performers feel held back" |
| Central vs. Local | "We want consistency BUT schools want autonomy" |
| Speed vs. Inclusion | "We want inclusive decisions BUT we also need to move fast" |
| Work-Life vs. Dedication | "We want sustainable workloads BUT the work is endless" |
| Data vs. Privacy | "We want data-informed decisions BUT we value privacy" |

---

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Listing barriers instead | "That's a problem to solve. What's the underlying tension?" |
| One-sided framing | "What's the other side? Why does this tension exist?" |
| Too abstract | "Give me a concrete example of this tension in action" |
| Blame-focused | "Let's focus on the tension, not who caused it" |
| Avoidance/discomfort | "This is meant to be uncomfortable. We're naming the hard truths." |
