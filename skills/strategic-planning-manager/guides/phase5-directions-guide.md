# Phase 5: Strategic Directions
## Facilitator Guide

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Define innovative actions that resolve contradictions and advance the practical vision.

**Duration:** 3-4 hours for workshop session

**AI Role:** Suggest evidence-based approaches, ensure coverage
**Human Role:** Decision-making, prioritization, ownership

---

## Key Concept: What Makes a Strategic Direction

Strategic Directions are NOT:
- Goals (outcomes we want)
- Tactics (specific activities)
- Business as usual (what we already do)

Strategic Directions ARE:
- Innovative approaches (new ways of working)
- Contradiction resolvers (address tensions identified)
- Vision enablers (create conditions for success)
- Multi-year commitments (sustained effort)

**The Test:** "Does this resolve a contradiction while advancing our vision? Is it a fundamentally different approach, not just more of what we do?"

## Facilitation Script

### Welcome & Framework (15 min)

**Say:**
"Today we define HOW we'll achieve our vision. We're developing Strategic Directions—innovative approaches that resolve our contradictions while advancing toward our vision.

Strategic Directions answer: 'What will we do differently?'

Not what we'll achieve (that's the vision).
Not specific activities (that's implementation).
But the fundamental approaches we'll take."

**Show framework:**

```
VISION          →  What we want to see
CONTRADICTIONS  →  Tensions blocking us
DIRECTIONS      →  How we'll navigate (TODAY)
IMPLEMENTATION  →  What we'll do specifically
```

**Say:**
"Each strategic direction should:
1. Resolve at least one major contradiction
2. Advance multiple vision categories
3. Be innovative—not just 'do more of X'
4. Be sustainable over 3 years"

### Contradiction-Vision Mapping (20 min)

**Say:**
"Before we brainstorm directions, let's map how our contradictions block specific parts of our vision."

**Create matrix on flip chart:**

| Contradiction | Vision Areas Blocked |
|---------------|----------------------|
| C1: [name] | [categories] |
| C2: [name] | [categories] |
| C3: [name] | [categories] |

**Ask:**
"For each contradiction, which vision categories are affected? Where do we see the most overlap—contradictions that block multiple vision areas?"

**Identify hotspots:**
"These are our highest-leverage opportunities—directions that address these will have the most impact."

### Direction Brainstorm (25 min)

**Say:**
"Now let's brainstorm potential directions. Think about each major contradiction and ask: 'What innovative approach could resolve this tension while advancing our vision?'

Write each idea on a sticky note. Focus on approaches, not activities.

Not: 'Train teachers in differentiation'
But: 'Create a culture of teacher innovation with permission to experiment'"

**Circulate and prompt:**
- "How might you honor BOTH sides of that tension?"
- "What would fundamentally change how you work?"
- "What do high-performing districts do here?"
- "What would be truly innovative for your context?"

**After 15 minutes:**
"Share at your tables. Look for similar directions. Combine where appropriate."

### Direction Development (Small Groups) (40 min)

**Say:**
"Each table will develop 1-2 strategic directions in depth. Use this template..."

**Template on flip chart:**

```
STRATEGIC DIRECTION: [Name]

Statement: [1-2 sentence description of the approach]

Contradictions Resolved:
- C#: [How this resolves it]
- C#: [How this resolves it]

Vision Categories Advanced:
- [Category]: [How this advances it]
- [Category]: [How this advances it]

Key Strategies (3-5):
1. [Strategy]
2. [Strategy]
3. [Strategy]

What's Different:
[How is this fundamentally different from current practice?]

Resources Required:
[High-level resource implications]
```

**Assign tables:**
"Table 1, develop directions for contradictions C1 and C2.
Table 2, focus on C3 and C4.
Table 3, focus on C5 and the vision areas not yet covered."

### Gallery Walk & Feedback (25 min)

**Say:**
"Post your directions on the wall. We'll do a gallery walk. Leave feedback using sticky notes:
- Green = 'I love this'
- Yellow = 'Question about this'
- Pink = 'Concern about this'"

**Walk protocol:**
- 5 min per station
- Read, discuss at your group, leave feedback
- Rotate

### Direction Refinement (20 min)

**Say:**
"Return to your own directions. Review the feedback. Discuss as a table:
- What resonated?
- What concerns should we address?
- How do we strengthen this direction?"

**Revise flip charts based on feedback.**

### Prioritization & Alignment (25 min)

**Part 1: Coverage Check (10 min)**

**Say:**
"Let's check: Are all major contradictions addressed? Are all vision categories supported?"

**Create alignment matrix:**

| Direction | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Vision Coverage |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| SD1 | ✓ | | ✓ | | | Learning, Equity |
| SD2 | | ✓ | | ✓ | | Staff, Culture |
| ... | | | | | | |

**Identify gaps:**
"Where do we see gaps? Do we need another direction, or can we expand existing ones?"

**Part 2: Prioritization (15 min)**

**Say:**
"If we could only do 3 things, which would have the most impact? Let's prioritize."

**Criteria for voting:**
1. Impact on vision achievement
2. Resolution of critical contradictions
3. Feasibility within 3 years

**Dot vote:** 3 dots per person. Vote for the directions that best meet these criteria.

### Ownership & Close (20 min)

**Say:**
"For our top-priority directions, let's identify preliminary ownership."

**For each direction:**
- "Who should lead this? (Cabinet-level owner)"
- "What departments are essential?"
- "What external support might be needed?"

**Close:**
"We now have our Strategic Directions—the innovative approaches that will resolve our contradictions and achieve our vision.

Next session: Implementation Planning. We'll map these to specific actions, timelines, and success indicators."

## Direction Quality Checklist

For each direction, verify:

- [ ] Is it an approach, not just a goal?
- [ ] Does it resolve at least one major contradiction?
- [ ] Does it advance multiple vision categories?
- [ ] Is it innovative for this context?
- [ ] Is it sustainable over 3 years?
- [ ] Is it within the district's sphere of influence?
- [ ] Does it have clear resource implications understood?

---

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Directions too vague | "Make it actionable. What would you actually DO differently?" |
| Directions too tactical | "Zoom out. This is the approach, not the activity." |
| Doesn't address contradiction | "How does this resolve the tension? Show the connection." |
| Too ambitious | "Is this achievable in 3 years with focused effort?" |
| Same as current practice | "What's fundamentally DIFFERENT about this?" |
| Too many directions | "Focus is power. Which 4-6 will have the most impact?" |

---

## Example Strategic Directions

For reference/prompting:

| Direction | Resolves | Advances |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| "Create a Culture of Continuous Improvement with Safe-to-Fail Experiments" | Innovation vs. Risk Aversion | Staff, Learning |
| "Build Flexible Pathways That Honor Individual Growth and Common Standards" | Personalization vs. Standardization | Learning, Equity |
| "Develop Distributed Leadership That Balances Autonomy with Coherence" | Central vs. Local | Staff, Culture |
| "Establish Community Partnerships as Core Strategy, Not Add-On" | Resource Constraints | Community, Learning |

---
