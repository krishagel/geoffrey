## Facilitation Script

### Welcome & Context (10 min)

**Say:**
"Welcome to our SWOT analysis session. Today we're taking everything we learned in discovery and organizing it into a strategic framework.

SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats:
- **Strengths** are internal, positive—what we do well
- **Weaknesses** are internal, negative—where we're limited
- **Opportunities** are external, positive—factors we can leverage
- **Threats** are external, negative—risks we need to navigate

Our goal today is to validate the draft SWOT, add your expertise, prioritize, and identify where we'll invest our energy."

### Review Discovery Findings (15 min)

**Say:**
"Let me highlight key findings from our discovery phase..."

Walk through:
- Participation summary (who we heard from)
- Top 3-5 themes that emerged
- Areas of strong agreement
- Areas of divergence

**Ask:**
"Any surprises? Anything missing from what you've heard in our community?"

### SWOT Validation - Small Groups (40 min)

**Instructions:**
"At your tables, you have the draft SWOT. Your job is to:
1. Review each quadrant (10 min each)
2. Add anything missing from your knowledge
3. Flag anything that doesn't belong
4. Star the 3 most important items in each quadrant

Work through all four quadrants. I'll keep time."

**Timing:**
- Strengths: 10 min
- Weaknesses: 10 min
- Opportunities: 10 min
- Threats: 10 min

**Circulate and prompt:**
- "What about [specific area]?"
- "Is there evidence for that?"
- "How significant is this?"

### SWOT Synthesis - Large Group (30 min)

**Process:**
1. Each table reports their top 3 per quadrant (5 min each)
2. Facilitator captures on chart paper
3. Look for patterns across tables
4. Discuss any contested items
5. Dot voting on priorities (3 dots per person per quadrant)

**Say:**
"Let's hear from each table. Share your top 3 for Strengths..."

After all input:
"Looking at what's on the wall—what patterns do you see? Where do we agree strongly?"

### Investment & Barriers Analysis (30 min)

**Part 1: Where Will We Invest? (15 min)**

**Say:**
"Now let's look at strategic opportunities. We do this by pairing Strengths with Opportunities.

The question is: What strengths can we leverage to capture opportunities?

Example: If our strength is 'Strong teacher professional learning culture' and our opportunity is 'Growing interest in personalized learning'—we might invest in 'Teacher-led innovation in personalization.'"

**Small group activity:**
"Identify 2-3 investment opportunities by pairing S+O. Write on chart paper."

Report out and capture.

**Part 2: What's Holding Us Back? (15 min)**

**Say:**
"Now let's identify our biggest barriers—the weaknesses that most limit our ability to achieve our vision.

These aren't just problems—they're the things that will block our strategic directions if we don't address them."

**Ask:**
"Looking at our weaknesses, which 3-5 are most critical to address? Which ones, if left unaddressed, will undermine everything else?"

Dot vote or discuss to prioritize.

### Next Steps & Close (15 min)

**Say:**
"Excellent work today. Here's what happens next:

1. I'll compile our SWOT into a clean document
2. You'll receive it for final review
3. At our next session, we'll develop our Practical Vision
4. Today's investment priorities and barriers will inform our strategic directions"

**Ask:**
"Any final thoughts before we close?"

## Key Facilitation Tips

### For Strengths Discussion

- Push beyond vague ("great teachers") to specific ("98% of teachers engaged in PLCs weekly")
- Ask "What evidence supports this?"
- Consider "Would outsiders agree this is a strength?"

### For Weaknesses Discussion

- Create psychological safety—this isn't blame
- Focus on systemic issues, not individuals
- Ask "What's the impact of this weakness?"

### For Opportunities Discussion

- Look beyond district boundaries
- Consider trends, demographics, policy, funding
- Ask "Is this within our influence to capture?"

### For Threats Discussion

- Be realistic, not alarmist
- Consider timeline (immediate vs. emerging)
- Ask "What's our ability to mitigate this?"

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Confusion between S/W and O/T | "Is this about us (internal) or about our environment (external)?" |
| Everything seems like a weakness | "Let's pause—what ARE we doing well? What would we protect?" |
| Generic/vague items | "Can you make that more specific? What's an example?" |
| Dominant voices | "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet." |
| Disagreement on an item | "Let's capture both perspectives and note the disagreement." |
