# Stage 3: Build the Plan & Align Resources
## Facilitator Guide

---

## Overview

**Key Question:** How will we get there?

**Purpose:** Translate strategic directions into concrete, measurable goals with clear ownership, resource alignment, and a Year 1 implementation timeline.

**Duration:** 3-4 hours for workshop session

**AI Role:** Structure creation, timeline drafting, metric suggestions
**Human Role:** Reality testing, commitment making, ownership assignment

---

## Key Concept: The Three-Column Approach

For each strategic direction, map progress across three horizons:

| Current Reality | 1-Year Accomplishments | 3-Year Outcomes |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Where we are now | What's true in 12 months | What's true at plan end |
| Honest assessment | Achievable milestones | Vision alignment |
| Evidence-based | Measurable progress | Transformation complete |

**Why this works:**
- Forces honest assessment of current state
- Creates accountability for Year 1
- Maintains focus on 3-year outcomes
- Makes progress visible and measurable

## Facilitation Script

### Welcome & Three-Column Training (15 min)

**Say:**
"Today we make our strategic directions real. We're creating implementation plans that will guide our work for the next three years.

We use a three-column approach:
1. **Current Reality:** Where are we NOW—honestly
2. **3-Year Outcomes:** Where we'll BE when the plan is complete
3. **1-Year Accomplishments:** What must be true after Year 1

Why this order? We start with honesty about now, define the destination, then identify Year 1 progress."

**Show example:**

```
STRATEGIC DIRECTION: Culture of Continuous Improvement

CURRENT REALITY           | 1-YEAR ACCOMPLISHMENTS      | 3-YEAR OUTCOMES
--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------
Teachers hesitant to      | 50% of teams running        | Innovation is
try new approaches        | improvement cycles          | embedded in culture

No safe-to-fail           | 3 school pilots of          | All schools have
experimentation           | innovation zones            | innovation structures

Mistakes are hidden       | Monthly "learning from      | Failures shared as
                          | failure" sessions           | learning opportunities
```

### Current Reality Assessment (30 min)

**Say:**
"At your direction tables, honestly assess where we are NOW. Not where we wish we were. Not where we're supposed to be. Where we ACTUALLY are.

Use evidence:
- What does data tell us?
- What would staff honestly say?
- What would students/families experience?

Write 5-8 current reality statements for your direction."

**Circulate and prompt:**
- "Is this really true, or is this aspirational?"
- "What evidence supports this?"
- "Would skeptics agree with this assessment?"
- "What are we avoiding saying?"

**Challenge overly positive assessments:**
"If things were that good, would we need a strategic direction here?"

### 3-Year Outcomes Definition (25 min)

**Say:**
"Now define the 3-year outcomes. By the end of Year 3, what will be true?

These should:
- Connect directly to our priority areas and vision
- Be observable and measurable
- Represent meaningful transformation
- Be ambitious but achievable

Write 5-8 outcome statements that match your current reality statements."

**Facilitate:**
- "How does this connect to our vision?"
- "Is this achievable in 3 years with focused effort?"
- "How would we know this outcome was achieved?"

### 1-Year Accomplishments (35 min)

**Say:**
"Now the critical bridge: Year 1 accomplishments. These are what must be true 12 months from now.

Year 1 is about foundation and momentum:
- What infrastructure needs to be in place?
- What pilots or proofs of concept will we run?
- What learning will we capture?
- What capacity will we build?

Year 1 accomplishments should be a credible bridge from current reality to 3-year outcomes."

**For each row in your template:**
"If this is current reality, and this is Year 3, what must be true at the end of Year 1?"

**Quality check:**
- "Is this achievable in 12 months?"
- "Is this ambitious enough to show real progress?"
- "Will this set us up for Years 2-3?"

### Success Indicators & Metrics (25 min)

**Say:**
"For each direction, we need 3-5 success indicators—measurable ways to track progress.

For each indicator, define:
- What we measure
- Current baseline (Year 0)
- Year 1 target
- Year 3 target
- How we'll measure it"

**Template:**

| Indicator | Baseline | Y1 Target | Y3 Target | Measurement Method |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| | | | | |

**Facilitate:**
- "Is this actually measurable?"
- "Do we have baseline data, or do we need to collect it?"
- "Will movement on this indicator show real progress?"
- "Are these leading or lagging indicators?"

**Push for balance:**
- Some quantitative (numbers)
- Some qualitative (surveys, perceptions)
- Mix of leading (activity) and lagging (outcome)

### Year 1 Quarterly Timeline (30 min)

**Say:**
"Let's break Year 1 into quarters. What happens when?"

**Template:**

| Q1 (Jul-Sep) | Q2 (Oct-Dec) | Q3 (Jan-Mar) | Q4 (Apr-Jun) |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Focus: | Focus: | Focus: | Focus: |
| Actions: | Actions: | Actions: | Actions: |
| Milestones: | Milestones: | Milestones: | Milestones: |
| Owner: | Owner: | Owner: | Owner: |

**Reality check:**
- "Is this realistic given the school calendar?"
- "When do we need budget for this?"
- "What about summer work?"
- "How does this sequence with other directions?"

### Cross-Direction Integration (20 min)

**Say:**
"Now let's look across all directions. Where do we have:
- Shared resources needed?
- Dependencies between directions?
- Potential conflicts in timing?
- Opportunities for synergy?"

Post all direction timelines on the wall. Look for:
- Resource conflicts (same people needed in multiple places)
- Logical dependencies (Direction A must happen before B)
- Integration opportunities (combine related work)

Adjust as needed.

### Commitment & Close (15 min)

**Say:**
"Let's make this real with commitments.

For each direction:
- Who is the Cabinet-level owner?
- Who are the key leads?
- When is the first milestone due?"

Go around the room:
"For [Direction], [Name] is committing to deliver [milestone] by [date]."

**Close:**
"We now have implementation plans for all strategic directions.

Next steps:
1. I'll compile these into the Strategic Plan document
2. You'll review and finalize
3. We'll develop detailed Year 1 action plans
4. Board presentation for adoption
5. Stage 4: monitoring, reporting, and continuous improvement"

---

## Resource Alignment Guide

For each direction, estimate:

**Personnel:**
- New positions needed?
- Existing staff time redirected?
- Outside expertise required?

**Budget:**
- Direct costs (materials, technology, contracts)
- Professional development
- Substitute coverage for release time

**Time:**
- Meeting/collaboration time
- Implementation hours
- Learning/iteration cycles

---

## Quality Checks

For each implementation plan, verify:

- [ ] Current reality is honest and evidence-based
- [ ] 3-year outcomes align with vision and priority areas
- [ ] Year 1 accomplishments are achievable and meaningful
- [ ] Success indicators are measurable with baselines
- [ ] Quarterly timeline is realistic given school calendar
- [ ] Owner is identified and committed
- [ ] Resources are estimated
- [ ] Dependencies noted and resolved

---

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Current reality too optimistic | "Would a skeptic agree? What would critics say?" |
| 3-year outcomes too vague | "How would we know this happened? What would we observe?" |
| Year 1 too ambitious | "Is this actually achievable in 12 months? What if we hit 70%?" |
| Year 1 too modest | "Will this create enough momentum? Will stakeholders see progress?" |
| No baseline data | "Can we collect baseline in Q1? What's our estimate now?" |
| Overlapping ownership | "Who is THE owner? Others support, but one person is accountable." |

---
