# Stage 4: Implement, Monitor & Improve
## Facilitator Guide

---

## Overview

**Key Question:** Are we making progress?

**Purpose:** Execute the strategic plan, track progress through data-driven monitoring, report to the board and community, and make mid-course adjustments as needed.

**Duration:** Ongoing (Years 1-3 of the plan)

**AI Role:** Dashboard creation, report drafting, data analysis, trend identification
**Human Role:** Implementation leadership, decision-making, accountability, communication

---

## Annual Action Plan Development

At the start of each plan year, develop a detailed action plan.

### Action Plan Template (Per Strategic Direction)

| Element | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Focus** | Foundation & launch | Deepen & scale | Sustain & embed |
| **SMART Goals** | 3-5 specific goals | 3-5 specific goals | 3-5 specific goals |
| **Key Actions** | Detailed action steps | Detailed action steps | Detailed action steps |
| **KPIs** | Leading + lagging | Leading + lagging | Leading + lagging |
| **Owner** | Named individual | Named individual | Named individual |
| **Resources** | Budget, staff, time | Budget, staff, time | Budget, staff, time |
| **Timeline** | Quarterly milestones | Quarterly milestones | Quarterly milestones |

### Writing SMART Goals

Each goal should be:
- **Specific:** Clear about what will be accomplished
- **Measurable:** Quantifiable or observable indicator
- **Achievable:** Realistic given resources and constraints
- **Relevant:** Aligned to the strategic direction
- **Time-bound:** Has a deadline

**Example:**
- Weak: "Improve math instruction"
- SMART: "By June 2027, 80% of math classrooms will implement standards-aligned curriculum with fidelity, as measured by instructional rounds observation data"

## Progress Monitoring Framework

### Review Cadence

| Review Type | Frequency | Participants | Focus |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Operational Check** | Monthly | Direction owners + leads | Action step progress, blockers |
| **Cabinet Review** | Quarterly | Full cabinet | Cross-direction progress, resource needs |
| **Board Report** | Semester (2x/year) | Board of Education | Strategic progress, outcomes, adjustments |
| **Stakeholder Update** | Annually | Community, staff, families | Transparency, celebration, input |
| **Deep Review** | Annually (spring) | Planning team | Full assessment, Year+1 action plan |

### What to Track: Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

**Leading Indicators** (predict future success):
- Activities completed (trainings held, pilots launched)
- Participation rates (staff engaged, students enrolled)
- Implementation fidelity scores
- Resource deployment milestones

**Lagging Indicators** (measure actual outcomes):
- Student achievement data
- Survey satisfaction scores
- Graduation/attendance rates
- Staff retention rates

**Rule of thumb:** Track 2-3 leading and 1-2 lagging indicators per direction.

### Dashboard Structure

For each strategic direction, maintain a scorecard:

```
STRATEGIC DIRECTION: [Name]
Owner: [Name]                    Status: 🟢 On Track / 🟡 Watch / 🔴 Off Track

┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SMART Goal 1: [Description]                               │
│ KPI: [Metric]  │  Baseline: [X]  │  Target: [Y]  │  Actual: [Z] │
│ Status: [🟢/🟡/🔴]  │  Trend: [↑/→/↓]                    │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ SMART Goal 2: [Description]                               │

## Board Reporting

### Report Format

**Semester Board Report Structure:**

1. **Executive Summary** (1 page)
   - Overall plan status (on track / needs attention / off track)
   - Key wins this period
   - Areas needing attention

2. **Direction-by-Direction Progress** (1 page per direction)
   - Scorecard summary
   - Key accomplishments
   - Challenges and mitigation
   - Data highlights

3. **Financial Summary** (1 page)
   - Budget vs. actual by direction
   - Resource reallocation requests

4. **Recommendations** (1 page)
   - Proposed adjustments
   - Board action items (if any)

### Board Presentation Tips

- Lead with outcomes, not activities ("Students improved by X" not "We held Y trainings")
- Be honest about challenges—boards respect candor
- Connect progress to the plan's strategic directions, not just operational work
- Include student/staff voices where possible
- Keep to 20-30 minutes with time for questions

---

## Stakeholder Communication Rhythm

| Audience | Channel | Frequency | Content |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Board | Formal report + presentation | Semester | Progress dashboards, data, recommendations |
| Cabinet | Working session | Monthly | Operational review, decisions, resource allocation |
| Principals | Leadership meeting | Quarterly | Implementation support, shared learning |
| Teachers/Staff | Newsletter / all-staff | Quarterly | Progress highlights, recognition, upcoming work |
| Families | Newsletter / website | Semester | Accessible summary, celebration, input opportunity |
| Community | Annual report / town hall | Annually | Full transparency, invite feedback |

### Communication Principles

- **Honest:** Share challenges alongside wins
- **Accessible:** No jargon, plain language
- **Consistent:** Same cadence, same format
- **Two-way:** Always include a feedback mechanism
- **Celebratory:** Recognize progress and contributors

---

## Mid-Course Adjustment Process

### Triggers for Adjustment

A mid-course adjustment is warranted when:

- A KPI is consistently off track (🔴 for two consecutive quarters)
- External conditions change significantly (funding, policy, demographics)
- A strategic direction proves infeasible or misaligned
- Stakeholder feedback indicates a disconnect
- Leadership transition requires realignment

### Adjustment Protocol

1. **Identify the issue** — What specifically is off track? What data shows this?
2. **Diagnose the cause** — Is it implementation failure, wrong strategy, or changed conditions?
3. **Propose options** — Adjust tactics, reallocate resources, modify goals, or retire direction
4. **Decide** — Cabinet or planning team makes the call
5. **Communicate** — Update stakeholders on the change and rationale
6. **Update the plan** — Revise the documented plan, dashboards, and action plans

### Adjustment vs. Abandonment

| Adjustment | Abandonment |
|------------|-------------|
| Change tactics, keep direction | Retire the direction entirely |
| Modify timeline or targets | Acknowledge it's no longer relevant |
| Reallocate resources | Redirect resources to other directions |
| Normal and expected | Rare but sometimes necessary |

---

## Annual Review Cycle

### Spring Annual Review (Planning Team, 2-3 hours)

**Agenda:**

| Time | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| 0:00 | Year in Review: Data Walk | 30 min |
| 0:30 | Direction-by-Direction Assessment | 45 min |
| 1:15 | Break | 10 min |
| 1:25 | Successes & Lessons Learned | 20 min |
| 1:45 | Year+1 Priority Setting | 30 min |
| 2:15 | Resource Alignment for Year+1 | 20 min |
| 2:35 | Commitments & Close | 15 min |
| 2:50 | End | |

**For each direction, assess:**
- What did we accomplish?
- What fell short and why?
- What did we learn?
- What shifts are needed for next year?
- Are our success indicators still the right ones?

### Year-End Scoring

Use a simple rating for each direction:

| Rating | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Exceeding** | Ahead of plan targets | Consider stretch goals or acceleration |
| **On Track** | Meeting plan targets | Continue current approach |
| **Progressing** | Below target but moving | Identify and remove barriers |
| **Stalled** | No meaningful progress | Major intervention or adjustment needed |
| **Off Track** | Moving away from goals | Reassess viability of direction |

## Mid-Plan Refresh (Year 2-3)

At the midpoint of a 3-year plan, conduct a more significant review:

### Refresh Process (Half-day session)

1. **Environmental Scan Update** (45 min)
   - What's changed externally since the plan was written?
   - New opportunities? New threats?
   - Policy, funding, demographic shifts?

2. **Progress Assessment** (45 min)
   - Which directions are on track?
   - Which need adjustment?
   - Any directions to retire or add?

3. **Stakeholder Input** (30 min)
   - Brief pulse survey before the session
   - Community feedback since plan launch
   - Staff perspective on implementation

4. **Revised Year 3 Priorities** (45 min)
   - What must we accomplish in the final year?
   - Where should we concentrate resources?
   - What's the finish-line definition of success?

5. **Updated Action Plan** (30 min)
   - Revised Year 3 goals and timelines
   - Resource reallocation
   - Updated ownership

## Leadership Transition Considerations

When a superintendent or key leader transitions during the plan:

**For Outgoing Leaders:**
- Document plan status, context, and institutional knowledge
- Brief the board on where each direction stands
- Identify critical dependencies on departing leadership

**For Incoming Leaders:**
- Provide full plan with current progress data
- Schedule briefings with direction owners
- Allow 90 days to assess before proposing changes
- Honor existing commitments while building understanding

**Principles:**
- The plan belongs to the community, not any individual leader
- Changes should be evolutionary, not revolutionary
- Stakeholder engagement built the plan—stakeholders should be engaged in any major changes

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Generate strategic plan document from all stage outputs
uv run skills/strategic-planning-manager/scripts/synthesize_plan.py \
  --work-dir ./planning \
  --output ./outputs/strategic-plan.md \
  --format full  # or 'executive', 'board', 'staff', 'community'
```

## Outputs

Stage 4 produces ongoing deliverables:

- [ ] Annual action plans (Year 1, 2, 3)
- [ ] Monthly/quarterly progress dashboards
- [ ] Semester board reports
- [ ] Stakeholder communication materials
- [ ] Mid-course adjustment documentation

---

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Data not collected on time | Build data collection into the calendar at year start |
| Direction owner not engaged | Superintendent must hold accountability conversations |
| Board wants different metrics | Align metrics during plan adoption, not after |
| Plan sits on shelf | Monthly operational reviews prevent this—make it the work |
| Too much reporting burden | Streamline: one dashboard format, reuse for all audiences |
| External shock (pandemic, budget crisis) | Use adjustment protocol; don't abandon the plan |
