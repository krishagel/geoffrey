# Stage 2: Set Direction
## Facilitator Guide

---

## Overview

**Key Question:** Where do we want to go?

**Purpose:** Define the organization's mission, vision, values, priority areas, and strategic directions that will guide the next 3 years.

**Duration:** 3-4 hours for combined workshop session (or split across two sessions)

**AI Role:** Provide prompts, capture input, suggest groupings, map alignment
**Human Role:** Decision-making, visioning, prioritization

---

## Part A: Define Vision, Mission, and Priorities

### Pre-Session Preparation

**Materials Needed:**
- [ ] SWOT summary with priorities (displayed on wall)
- [ ] Discovery key findings (reference)
- [ ] Chart paper, markers, sticky notes
- [ ] Mission/Vision/Values worksheet (if existing statements need review)
- [ ] Timer

**Pre-Work for Participants (send 2-3 days before):**
- SWOT summary with investment priorities and barriers
- Prompt: "Reflect on what our district should stand for and where we should be in 3 years"

### Session Agenda: Vision, Mission & Priorities (1.5 hours)

| Time | Activity | Duration | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| 0:00 | Welcome & Stage 2 Framing | 10 min | |
| 0:10 | Review/Reaffirm Mission & Vision | 25 min | |
| 0:35 | Define Core Values | 15 min | |
| 0:50 | Identify Priority Areas | 25 min | |
| 1:15 | Define Long-Term Outcome Goals | 15 min | |
| 1:30 | Break / Transition to Part B | | |

### Facilitation Script

**Welcome & Framing (10 min):**

"In Stage 1, we assessed where we are. Now we define where we want to go.

Today we'll:
1. Reaffirm or refine our mission, vision, and values
2. Identify 3-6 priority areas for the next 3 years
3. Define strategic directions—innovative approaches to reach our goals

By the end, we'll have a clear picture of our destination and the paths we'll take to get there."

**Review/Reaffirm Mission & Vision (25 min):**

*If the district has existing statements:*

"Let's look at our current mission and vision. Do these still represent who we are and where we want to go?

Our mission is: [read current mission]
Our vision is: [read current vision]

Questions:
- Does this still ring true?
- Does it reflect what we heard in Stage 1?
- What would you change?"

*If creating new statements:*

"We need to define two things:
- **Mission:** Why we exist (present tense, enduring)
- **Vision:** What success looks like in 3 years (future tense, aspirational but achievable)

At your tables, draft a 1-2 sentence mission and vision. Think: clear enough for a parent to understand, specific enough to guide decisions."

Table work (10 min) → Share and synthesize (15 min)

> *For organizations wanting to define a Profile of a Graduate (the competencies every student should have upon graduation), see Appendix C: Developing a Profile of a Graduate. This work naturally complements vision development and can inform priority areas and strategic directions.*

**Define Core Values (15 min):**

"Values are the non-negotiables—how we will and won't operate as we pursue our vision. Not a wish list, but actual commitments.

At your tables, identify 3-5 values that should guide this plan. For each, write a single sentence explaining what it means in practice."

Quick share and consolidate to 3-5 shared values.

**Identify Priority Areas (25 min):**

"Based on our SWOT, our vision, and what we've heard from stakeholders—what are the 3-6 areas where we must focus our energy over the next 3 years?

These are broad areas, not specific actions. Examples: Student Learning & Achievement, Equity & Access, Staff Development & Retention, Community Engagement."

Process:
1. Individual brainstorm (5 min) — Write each priority area on a sticky note
2. Table consolidation (10 min) — Group similar ideas, identify table's top 4-6
3. Large group synthesis (10 min) — Post, cluster, name, agree on final 3-6 areas

**Define Long-Term Outcome Goals (15 min):**

"For each priority area, what's the 'North Star'—the long-term outcome we're aiming for?

Write one sentence per priority area that describes what success looks like in 3 years."

Example:
- Priority: Equity & Access
- North Star: "Every student, regardless of background, has equitable access to rigorous learning opportunities and achieves at high levels."

## Part B: Develop Strategic Directions

### Key Concept: What Makes a Strategic Direction

Strategic Directions are NOT:
- Goals (outcomes we want)
- Tactics (specific activities)
- Business as usual (what we already do)

Strategic Directions ARE:
- Innovative approaches (new ways of working)
- Vision enablers (create conditions for success)
- Multi-year commitments (sustained effort)

**The Test:** "Is this a fundamentally different approach, not just more of what we do?"

> *For organizations wanting to surface deep structural tensions before setting directions, see Appendix B: Organizational Tension Analysis.*

### Session Agenda: Strategic Directions (2 hours)

| Time | Activity | Duration | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| 0:00 | Strategic Directions Framework | 15 min | |
| 0:15 | Direction Brainstorm | 25 min | |
| 0:40 | Direction Development (Small Groups) | 35 min | |
| 1:15 | Break | 10 min | |
| 1:25 | Gallery Walk & Feedback | 20 min | |
| 1:45 | Prioritization & Alignment | 20 min | |
| 2:05 | Ownership & Close | 15 min | |
| 2:20 | End | | |

### Facilitation Script

**Strategic Directions Framework (15 min):**

"Now we define HOW we'll achieve our vision. Strategic directions answer: 'What will we do differently?'

Each strategic direction should:
1. Advance multiple priority areas
2. Be innovative—not just 'do more of X'
3. Be sustainable over 3 years"

Show framework:
```
VISION           →  Where we want to be
PRIORITY AREAS   →  Where we'll focus
DIRECTIONS       →  How we'll get there (TODAY)
IMPLEMENTATION   →  What we'll do specifically
```

> *For organizations wanting a deeper participatory vision process before defining directions, see Appendix A: Deep Vision Development.*

**Direction Brainstorm (25 min):**

"Think about our priority areas and the barriers from our SWOT. What innovative approaches could advance our vision?

Write each idea on a sticky note. Focus on approaches, not activities.

Not: 'Train teachers in differentiation'
But: 'Create a culture of teacher innovation with permission to experiment'"

Circulate and prompt:
- "What would fundamentally change how you work?"
- "What do high-performing districts do here?"
- "What would be truly innovative for our context?"

After 15 min: Share at tables, look for common themes.

**Direction Development - Small Groups (35 min):**

"Each table will develop 1-2 strategic directions in depth."

Template on flip chart:
```
STRATEGIC DIRECTION: [Name]

Statement: [1-2 sentence description of the approach]

Priority Areas Served:
- [Area]: [How this advances it]
- [Area]: [How this advances it]

Key Strategies (3-5):
1. [Strategy]
2. [Strategy]
3. [Strategy]

What's Different:
[How is this fundamentally different from current practice?]

Resource Level: Low / Medium / High
```

**Gallery Walk & Feedback (20 min):**

"Post your directions on the wall. Gallery walk with feedback:
- Green sticky = 'I support this'
- Yellow sticky = 'Question about this'
- Pink sticky = 'Concern about this'"

5 min per station, rotate.

**Prioritization & Alignment (20 min):**

Coverage check: "Are all priority areas addressed? Do directions work together?"

Alignment matrix:
| Direction | Priority 1 | Priority 2 | Priority 3 | Priority 4 |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| SD1 | ✓ | | ✓ | |
| SD2 | | ✓ | | ✓ |

Dot vote (3 dots per person): Vote for the directions with highest impact and feasibility.

**Ownership & Close (15 min):**

For each direction:
- "Who should lead this? (Cabinet-level owner)"
- "What departments are essential?"

"We now have our strategic directions. Next: we'll build the detailed plan with goals, metrics, timelines, and resource alignment."

## Direction Quality Checklist

For each direction, verify:
- [ ] Is it an approach, not just a goal?
- [ ] Does it advance multiple priority areas?
- [ ] Is it innovative for this context?
- [ ] Is it sustainable over 3 years?
- [ ] Is it within the district's sphere of influence?
- [ ] Are resource implications understood?

---

## Outputs

By end of Stage 2:
- [ ] Mission, Vision, and Values (reaffirmed or new)
- [ ] 3-6 priority areas with long-term outcome goals
- [ ] 4-6 strategic directions fully developed
- [ ] Alignment mapping (directions to priorities)
- [ ] Preliminary ownership assigned
- [ ] Priorities established via dot voting

---

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Mission/Vision wordsmithing | Set time limit. "Good enough to guide us. We can refine language later." |
| Too many priorities | "Focus is power. Which 3-6 will have the most impact?" |
| Directions too vague | "Make it actionable. What would you actually DO differently?" |
| Directions too tactical | "Zoom out. This is the approach, not the activity." |
| Same as current practice | "What's fundamentally DIFFERENT about this?" |
| Too ambitious | "Is this achievable in 3 years with focused effort?" |

---

## Handoff to Stage 3

Before moving to Build the Plan:
- [ ] Mission/Vision/Values finalized
- [ ] Priority areas confirmed
- [ ] Strategic directions validated with planning team
- [ ] Direction owners identified
- [ ] Participants briefed on implementation planning process
