## Engagement & Communication Rhythm

| When | What | Audience |

| Month 1-2 | Surveys and focus groups | Students, staff, families, community |
| Month 2 | Discovery findings summary | Planning team, board |

## Quick Tips

- **Don't skip Month 1-2 data collection.** Plans built without stakeholder data lack credibility and buy-in.
- **Month 3 is the strategic heart.** Protect this time. Don't rush direction-setting to meet a deadline.
- **Build in feedback loops.** The draft plan in Month 5 should change based on input. If nothing changes, you didn't listen.
- **Month 6 is not the end.** It's the beginning of implementation. Plan the kickoff with the same energy as the retreat.
- **Adjust the timeline, not the stages.** If you need 8 months instead of 6, stretch it. Don't skip stages.
- **Retreats accelerate the middle.** A 2-day retreat in Month 3 can combine Stages 1-3 (assessment review + direction-setting + initial plan building).

## Alternative Timelines

### Accelerated (4 months)

Possible with existing data, experienced facilitator, and dedicated planning team.
- Month 1: Engage & Assess (compressed—existing data only)
- Month 2: Set Direction (retreat format)
- Month 3: Build the Plan + draft
- Month 4: Feedback, adoption, launch

### Extended (9-12 months)

Better for first-time planning, broad community engagement, or complex districts.
- Months 1-3: Engage & Assess (extensive data collection)
- Months 4-5: Set Direction (multiple sessions)
- Months 6-8: Build the Plan (detailed development)
- Months 9-10: Feedback and revision
- Months 11-12: Adoption and launch
