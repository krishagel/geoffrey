# Appendix C: Developing a Profile of a Graduate
## Defining the Competencies Every Graduate Should Have

---

## When to Use This

Use this appendix when your organization wants to **define the competencies, dispositions, and knowledge every student should have upon graduation**. This is a multi-session process (3-6 months) that engages the full community in building a shared vision for student outcomes.

This exercise is referenced from the Stage 2 guide. It can be:
- Run before strategic planning to inform vision and priorities
- Developed alongside Stage 2 (vision, mission, strategic directions)
- Used when a district is creating a new graduate profile or updating an outdated one

**Other names for this work:** Portrait of a Graduate, Profile of a Learner, Learner Profile, Graduate Aims, Graduate Competencies.

**Skip this if:** The district has a recent, community-validated profile that still reflects current values. In that case, reference the existing profile during Stage 2 direction-setting.

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Articulate 4-8 competency categories that define what every graduate should know, be able to do, and be like upon completion of their K-12 education.

**Duration:** Multi-session process spanning 3-6 months (not a single workshop)

**AI Role:** Research support, draft synthesis, prompt generation, equity analysis
**Human Role:** Community engagement, facilitation, decision-making, adoption

---

## Key Principle

A **Profile of a Graduate** IS:
- A community-built competency framework
- 4-8 categories with descriptions and observable indicators
- A north star that connects to curriculum, instruction, and assessment
- A living document that evolves with community input

A **Profile of a Graduate** IS NOT:
- A marketing slogan or tagline
- A curriculum map or scope-and-sequence
- A list borrowed from another district without local grounding
- A poster on the wall that nobody references

**The Test:** "Can a teacher look at this profile and know what to prioritize in their classroom? Can a student self-assess against these competencies? Can a parent understand what their child is working toward?"

---

## Pre-Work

### Steering Committee Formation

Form a 15-25 person committee representing:
- [ ] District leadership (superintendent, cabinet)
- [ ] School administrators (elementary, middle, high)
- [ ] Teachers (multiple grade levels and content areas)
- [ ] **Students** (high school, ideally middle school too)
- [ ] Parents/guardians (diverse backgrounds)
- [ ] School board members (1-2)
- [ ] Community members (business, nonprofit, higher ed)
- [ ] Support staff

**Critical:** Student voice is not optional. Students must be on the steering committee, not just consulted.

### Landscape Review

Before engaging the community, research what exists:
- [ ] State competency frameworks or profile requirements
- [ ] Neighboring district profiles (what's working, what isn't)
- [ ] National frameworks (Battelle for Kids, NGLC, Digital Promise)
- [ ] Employer surveys on desired graduate skills
- [ ] Higher education readiness expectations
- [ ] District's existing mission, vision, and values

### Student Voice Collection

Begin gathering student input early:
- [ ] Student surveys across grade bands
- [ ] Student focus groups (see facilitation script below)
- [ ] Student advisory or leadership group input
- [ ] Recent graduate feedback (1-3 years out)

### Data Review

Compile relevant data:
- [ ] Graduate outcomes (college enrollment, employment, military)
- [ ] Student survey data on school experience
- [ ] Community survey data on district expectations
- [ ] Labor market projections for the region

---

## Phase 1: Discover & Gather (2-4 weeks)

**Purpose:** Collect broad community input on what a successful graduate looks like.

### Activities

**1. Community Input Sessions (2-3 sessions, 2-3 hours each)**

Hold workshops in accessible locations at varied times. See full facilitation script below.

Key question: *"What should every graduate of our district be able to do, know, and be?"*

**2. Student Visioning Workshops (2-3 sessions, 1.5 hours each)**

Adapted sessions for student voices. See student facilitation script below.

Key questions:
- "What skills do you actually use outside school?"
- "What do you wish school prepared you for?"

**3. Employer & Higher Education Input**

- Interviews or panel discussion with local employers
- Input from community college and university partners
- Question: "What do you need graduates to be able to do?"

**4. Research Review**

Steering committee reviews:
- Battelle for Kids Portrait of a Graduate framework
- State-level examples (Virginia, South Carolina, others)
- District examples (Chandler USD, others in your region)
- Current research on future-ready competencies

### Phase 1 Output
- Raw input from all community sessions (organized by theme)
- Student input summary
- Employer/higher ed input summary
- Research landscape summary
- Emerging themes document

---

## Phase 2: Draft & Iterate (2-4 weeks)

**Purpose:** Synthesize input into a draft profile with competency categories, descriptions, and indicators.

### Activities

**1. Competency Category Development**

Steering committee reviews all input and identifies 4-8 recurring themes. These become the competency categories.

Process:
1. Individual review of input themes (15 min)
2. Small group clustering — "What categories emerge?" (20 min)
3. Large group synthesis — Agree on 4-8 categories (30 min)
4. Naming — Create clear, aspirational names for each category (20 min)

**2. Drafting Descriptions and Indicators**

For each category, develop:
- **Description:** 2-3 sentences defining the competency
- **Observable Indicators:** 3-5 specific, measurable behaviors or capabilities

Working in pairs or small groups, draft descriptions and indicators for assigned categories. Then review as full committee.

Quality checks for each indicator:
- Is it observable? (Can you see or measure it?)
- Is it grade-level appropriate? (Achievable by graduation?)
- Is it culturally responsive? (Accessible to all students?)
- Is it distinct? (Not duplicating another category?)

**3. Equity Lens Review**

Dedicated session to examine the draft through an equity lens:
- "Whose voice is well-represented? Whose is missing?"
- "Who benefits from this profile as written? Who might be left out?"
- "Are these competencies accessible to every student, including those with disabilities, English learners, and students experiencing poverty?"
- "Do these reflect our full community's values or primarily the dominant culture?"

**4. Feedback Rounds**

Share draft with:
- All original community input session participants
- Student groups
- Staff (all-staff meeting or survey)
- Board (preview, not adoption)

Collect specific feedback:
- "What resonates?"
- "What's missing?"
- "What language should change?"

### Phase 2 Output
- Draft profile with 4-8 categories
- Each category has description and 3-5 indicators
- Equity review summary
- Feedback summary with recommended revisions

---

## Phase 3: Validate & Adopt (2-4 weeks)

**Purpose:** Finalize the profile through community validation and formal board adoption.

### Activities

**1. Community Validation Sessions**

Present the near-final profile to community groups:
- "Does this represent what you told us?"
- "Would you be proud if your child met this profile?"
- "Is anything missing or misrepresented?"

Make final revisions based on feedback.

**2. Board Presentation and Adoption**

- Present the development process (who was involved, how input was gathered)
- Present the profile with evidence of community support
- Board discussion and formal adoption
- Board resolution establishing the profile as a guiding document

**3. Visual Design**

After board adoption:
- Professional graphic design of the profile
- Student-friendly version
- Multiple languages as needed
- Digital and print formats

**4. Launch Communication**

- Staff introduction (before public launch)
- Community announcement
- Student assembly or classroom introduction
- Website and social media
- Press release

### Phase 3 Output
- Board-adopted Profile of a Graduate
- Professionally designed visual version
- Student-friendly version
- Communication materials
- Board resolution

---

## Phase 4: Operationalize (Ongoing)

**Purpose:** Connect the profile to every aspect of the educational system. This is where most districts fail.

**Critical:** A profile that doesn't connect to curriculum, instruction, and assessment is a poster on the wall. This phase is what makes it real.

### Activities

**1. Curriculum Alignment**

- Audit existing curriculum against profile competencies
- Identify gaps — "Which competencies lack intentional development?"
- Map where each competency is explicitly taught and practiced
- Develop curriculum guides that reference profile competencies

**2. Assessment Alignment**

- Develop rubrics for each competency category
- Create student self-assessment tools
- Build portfolio or capstone requirements aligned to the profile
- Integrate into report cards or progress reporting

**3. Professional Development**

- Train all staff on the profile and its implications
- Develop instructional strategies for each competency
- Create professional learning communities around profile implementation
- Provide examples of profile-aligned instruction across content areas

**4. Student Self-Assessment**

- Students regularly assess their growth against the profile
- Student-led conferences reference the profile
- Senior capstone or portfolio demonstrates profile competencies
- Students can articulate the profile and their progress

**5. Progress Monitoring**

- Annual review of profile implementation
- Student outcome data disaggregated by profile competency
- Community pulse check — "Is this still what we want?"
- Board reporting on profile implementation progress

- Tables of 6-8 (mixed stakeholder groups)
- Large sticky notes and markers at each table
- Profile question visible on wall/screen
- Wall space for posting and clustering

### Agenda

| Time | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| 0:00 | Welcome & Framing | 15 min |
| 0:15 | Individual Brainstorm | 15 min |
| 0:30 | Table Sharing & Discussion | 20 min |
| 0:50 | Wall Posting | 10 min |
| 1:00 | Break | 10 min |
| 1:10 | Clustering & Naming | 25 min |
| 1:35 | Equity Pause | 15 min |
| 1:50 | Prioritization | 20 min |
| 2:10 | Indicator Development | 30 min |
| 2:40 | Closing & Next Steps | 20 min |
| 3:00 | End | |

### Welcome & Framing (15 min)

**Say:**
"Thank you for being here. Tonight we're tackling one of the most important questions in education:

**What should every graduate of our district be able to do, know, and be?**

Not just academically — though that matters. We're talking about the complete person. What skills, knowledge, and qualities should every student have when they walk across that stage?

This isn't about what college they get into or what test scores they earn. This is about the human being we're developing.

We're calling this a Profile of a Graduate — a shared definition of success that will guide everything we do as a district."

**Set context:**
"Here's how tonight works:
1. You'll brainstorm individually
2. Share at your tables
3. We'll look for patterns as a group
4. We'll pressure-test for equity
5. We'll begin to prioritize

Your input is the raw material. A steering committee will synthesize everything into a draft, bring it back to you, and refine it before board adoption."

### Individual Brainstorm (15 min)

**Say:**
"On your sticky notes, write ONE idea per note. Answer this question:

**What should every graduate of our district be able to do, know, and be?**

Think broadly:
- Skills they should have
- Knowledge they should hold
- Character qualities they should demonstrate
- Things they should be able to do in the real world

Write as many as you can — aim for 8-10. Be specific. Not 'be smart' but 'think critically about information and make evidence-based decisions.'

Go."

**Circulate and prompt:**
- "Think about what you needed after graduation that school didn't prepare you for."
- "Think about what employers are asking for."
- "Think about what makes a good neighbor, citizen, family member."
- "Think about skills that will matter in 10 years, not just today."

### Table Sharing & Discussion (20 min)

**Say:**
"Share your ideas at your table. Look for overlaps and build on each other's thinking. As a table, select your TOP 10-12 ideas to post on the wall. Write them clearly."

### Wall Posting (10 min)

**Say:**
"One person from each table, bring your notes to the wall. Post them all — don't organize yet."

### Break (10 min)

**Say:**
"Take a break. Walk the wall when you come back. Read what others wrote. Notice patterns."

### Clustering & Naming (25 min)

**Say:**
"Let's find the patterns. Without talking first, move notes that seem related closer together. Then we'll discuss."

Silent clustering (10 min), then discussion (15 min).

**Facilitate:**
- "Is this one cluster or two?"
- "What's the common thread here?"
- "What would you call this group?"

**Aim for 4-8 clusters.** Name each one with a clear, aspirational title.

### Equity Pause (15 min)

**Say:**
"Before we go further, let's pause and examine what we've created through an equity lens.

Questions to consider:
- **Whose voice is missing from this room tonight?** Who in our community isn't represented?
- **Who benefits from this profile?** Would every student see themselves here?
- **Who might be left out?** Are there competencies that assume certain cultural backgrounds, resources, or abilities?
- **Are these accessible to every student?** Including students with disabilities, English learners, students experiencing poverty?"

Table discussion (10 min), then brief large group share (5 min).

**Capture any additions or modifications.**

### Prioritization (20 min)

**Say:**
"We likely have more categories than we can effectively pursue. Research shows that 4-8 categories are ideal — enough to be meaningful, few enough to actually drive change.

Using your dots, vote for the categories you believe are MOST essential. Each person gets 5 dots. Place them on the categories you feel strongest about. You can put multiple dots on one category."

Count, rank, and discuss the top 4-8.

### Indicator Development (30 min)

**Say:**
"For our top categories, let's start defining what these actually look like. At your tables, take one category and answer:

- What would a graduate who has this competency be able to DO?
- What would you SEE them doing?
- How would you KNOW they have this?

Write 3-5 specific, observable indicators."

Table work (15 min) → Share out (15 min)

### Closing & Next Steps (20 min)

**Say:**
"Here's what happens next:
1. The steering committee will compile all of tonight's input
2. We'll combine this with student input and research
3. A draft profile will be created
4. You'll have a chance to review and give feedback
5. The final profile goes to the board for adoption

Thank you. Your voice matters in defining what success looks like for our students."

## Facilitation Script: Student Voice Session (1.5 hours)

### Setup

- Comfortable, informal seating (not classroom style)
- Snacks
- Sticky notes, markers, large paper
- No administrators in the room during the session (builds honesty)
- Student facilitators or youth-friendly adult facilitators preferred

### Agenda

| Time | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| 0:00 | Welcome & Icebreaker | 10 min |
| 0:10 | Real-World Skills | 20 min |
| 0:30 | Wishes & Gaps | 20 min |
| 0:50 | Break | 5 min |
| 0:55 | Defining Success | 20 min |
| 1:15 | Priority & Advice | 15 min |
| 1:30 | End | |

### Welcome & Icebreaker (10 min)

**Say:**
"We're here because your perspective matters — probably more than anyone else's. You're the ones actually going through school right now. We want to know what you think every student should learn, be able to do, and become by the time they graduate.

There are no wrong answers. We want your honest opinions."

Icebreaker: "What's one skill you've learned OUTSIDE of school that you use all the time?"

### Real-World Skills (20 min)

**Say:**
"Think about your life outside of school — jobs, hobbies, relationships, social media, volunteering, whatever you do.

**What skills do you actually use outside of school?**

Write one skill per sticky note. Be honest — this isn't about what teachers want to hear."

Individual brainstorm (5 min) → Share and cluster (15 min)

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Which of these did school help you develop?"
- "Which did you learn on your own?"
- "Which ones do you think every student should have?"

### Wishes & Gaps (20 min)

**Say:**
"Now think about what's missing.

**What do you wish school prepared you for?**

This could be practical skills, life skills, knowledge, anything. What should school be teaching that it isn't?"

Individual brainstorm (5 min) → Table discussion (15 min)

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "What do graduates need that they're not getting?"
- "What surprised you when you got to high school / started working / started making your own decisions?"
- "What do adults seem unprepared for that school could have helped with?"

### Break (5 min)

### Defining Success (20 min)

**Say:**
"Here's the big question:

**What does a successful person look like to you?**

Not famous or rich — just someone you'd say is doing well in life. What qualities do they have? What can they do?"

Individual brainstorm (5 min) → Group discussion (15 min)

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Think about someone you admire who isn't famous. What makes them successful?"
- "What would you want to be able to say about yourself 5 years after graduation?"
- "What does 'ready for life' actually mean?"

### Priority & Advice (15 min)

**Say:**
"Looking at everything on the wall — if you could only pick 5 things that every graduate should have, what would they be?

Dot vote: 5 dots each."

After voting:

"One last question: **What advice would you give the adults designing this profile?** What do they usually get wrong?"

Capture responses. Thank students.

## Common Competency Categories in K-12

Reference table for common categories seen in profiles across the country:

| Category | Description | Example Indicators |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Critical Thinking & Problem Solving** | Analyze information, evaluate evidence, solve complex problems | Identifies bias in sources; designs solutions to real-world problems |
| **Communication** | Express ideas effectively across formats and audiences | Writes clearly for different audiences; presents with confidence; listens actively |
| **Collaboration** | Work productively with diverse teams toward shared goals | Navigates disagreement constructively; contributes equitably to group work |
| **Creativity & Innovation** | Generate original ideas, take intellectual risks, iterate | Proposes novel approaches; learns from failure; connects ideas across disciplines |
| **Civic & Global Responsibility** | Engage ethically in local and global communities | Participates in civic life; understands diverse perspectives; acts on injustice |
| **Personal Management & Wellness** | Manage oneself, maintain well-being, demonstrate resilience | Sets and pursues goals; manages stress; advocates for own needs |
| **Digital & Information Literacy** | Navigate digital environments responsibly and effectively | Evaluates online information critically; uses technology as a tool; protects digital identity |
| **Career & Life Readiness** | Prepare for postsecondary success in work and life | Manages finances; navigates applications and interviews; adapts to new environments |

**Note:** These are reference categories, not a prescribed framework. Your community's profile should emerge from local input, not be borrowed wholesale.

---

## Connecting Profile to Strategic Plan

The Profile of a Graduate directly informs multiple elements of the strategic plan:

### Stage 2: Vision, Priorities, Directions
- The profile IS the district's vision for student outcomes
- Priority areas should align to profile competencies
- Strategic directions should advance profile implementation

### Stage 3: Goals, Metrics, Implementation
- Goals should reference specific profile competencies
- Success indicators should include profile-aligned measures
- Implementation plans should include curriculum alignment and assessment development

### Stage 4: Monitoring & Improvement
- Progress monitoring includes profile implementation status
- Annual reviews assess whether graduates are demonstrating profile competencies
- Community check-ins validate continued relevance

**Integration question for each strategic direction:** "How does this direction help students develop the competencies in our Profile of a Graduate?"

---

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Poster on the wall" syndrome — profile exists but nobody uses it | Connect to curriculum audit in Year 1. Build into teacher evaluation, student portfolios, and report cards. |
| Too many competencies — 10+ categories dilute focus | Limit to 4-8 categories. If groups generate more, force prioritization. "Which 6 are truly essential?" |
| Adult-only voice — students excluded from development | Mandate student sessions. Put students on the steering committee. Run separate student workshops. |
| Generic/borrowed profile — adopted from another district without local grounding | Ground every competency in local community input. If it could belong to any district, it doesn't belong to yours. |
| No assessment plan — competencies without indicators or rubrics | Build observable indicators from day one. Each competency needs 3-5 measurable behaviors. |
| All academics, no whole-child — profile reads like a curriculum | Ensure character, citizenship, and life skills are represented. Use the equity pause to check breadth. |
| No connection to instruction — teachers don't know what to do with it | Professional development plan must be part of Phase 4. Every teacher should be able to name the competencies and describe how their class develops them. |
| Profile gets adopted, then forgotten — no review cycle | Build annual review into Stage 4. Community pulse check every 2-3 years. |

## Example Profiles

Several states and districts have developed profiles that may serve as useful references during the research phase:

- **Virginia:** State-level Profile of a Virginia Graduate with 5 Cs (critical thinking, creative thinking, collaboration, communication, citizenship)
- **South Carolina:** State-mandated Profile of the South Carolina Graduate with world-class knowledge, skills, and life characteristics
- **Chandler Unified School District (AZ):** Locally developed profile with community input process
- **Battelle for Kids:** National framework used by many districts to guide profile development

**Important:** Reference these for process and structure inspiration, but do not adopt another organization's profile wholesale. The value of a Profile of a Graduate comes from the community engagement process, not the final document.
