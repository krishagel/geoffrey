# Phase 3: Practical Vision Development
## Facilitator Guide

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Define what success looks like in 3 years through collaborative brainstorming and consensus building.

**Duration:** 3-4 hours for workshop session

**AI Role:** Provide prompts, capture input, suggest groupings
**Human Role:** Primary creators of vision content

---

## Key Principle

A **Practical Vision** is NOT:
- A mission statement
- Vague aspirations
- What we're doing now

A **Practical Vision** IS:
- Concrete, observable outcomes
- What will be different in 3 years
- Stakeholder-focused changes
- Achievable but ambitious

**The Test:** "If I walked into this district in 3 years, what would I see, hear, and experience?"

## Facilitation Script

### Welcome & Context (10 min)

**Say:**
"Today we're building our Practical Vision—a concrete picture of what our district looks like in 3 years if we're successful.

This isn't about what we're doing now, or vague hopes. It's about specific, observable outcomes. Think about:
- What students will experience
- What families will see
- What staff will be doing differently
- What our community will notice

The key question: **It's [year + 3]. You walk into our district. What do you see that makes you proud?**"

### Individual Brainstorm (15 min)

**Say:**
"Take 15 minutes. On your sticky notes, write ONE idea per note. Complete this sentence: 'In 3 years, I see...'

Write as many as you can. Aim for at least 8-10 ideas. They can be about any aspect of the district—learning, climate, staff, community, anything.

Be specific. Not 'good instruction' but 'teachers using data to personalize learning for every student.'

Go."

**Circulate and prompt:**
- "What about students? What will they experience?"
- "What will families notice?"
- "What about staff culture?"
- "Think about equity—what will be different?"

### Pair Share (10 min)

**Say:**
"Turn to a partner. Share your ideas. Look for overlaps and build on each other's thinking. Combine similar ideas onto one note if you'd like."

### Table Consolidation (20 min)

**Say:**
"At your table, share all your ideas. Group similar ones together. As a table, identify your TOP 10-12 ideas to post on the wall.

Write clearly—these will be read from a distance. One idea per note."

### Wall Posting (10 min)

**Say:**
"One person from each table, bring your notes to the wall and post them. Don't organize yet—just post them all in your table's section."

### Break (10 min)

**Say:**
"Take a break. When you come back, walk the wall. Read what other tables wrote. Notice patterns."

### Clustering Round 1 (25 min)

**Say:**
"Now we cluster. Without talking, move notes that seem related closer together. If you see two ideas that belong together, put them near each other.

Don't create formal categories yet—just cluster by similarity. Work silently for 10 minutes."

After silent clustering:

**Say:**
"Now you can talk. Discuss the clusters you see forming. Continue to refine groupings. What themes are emerging?"

### Clustering Round 2 (20 min)

**Say:**
"Let's formalize the clusters. We're aiming for 8-10 distinct categories.

Work as a group to:
1. Define clear cluster boundaries
2. Move any outliers to where they fit best
3. Identify any gaps—is something missing?"

**Facilitate:**
- "Is this one cluster or two?"
- "Where does this note belong?"
- "What's the common thread in this cluster?"

### Naming Categories (25 min)

**Say:**
"Now we name each cluster. The name should capture the essence of what's in that column.

Not just 'Technology' but 'Technology That Empowers Learning'
Not just 'Staff' but 'Supported, Growing Professionals'

Work in pairs or small groups—each pair takes 2-3 columns. Write a name on the header card."

After naming:
**Large group review each name:**
- "Does this name capture what's here?"
- "Is it aspirational enough?"
- "Is it too vague?"

### Vision Narrative (20 min)

**Say:**
"For each category, let's create a 2-3 sentence narrative. What's the story of this vision area?

I'll capture these as we discuss. Let's start with [first category]..."

**For each category, ask:**
- "In plain language, what does this mean for our district?"
- "What will people experience?"
- "How will we know we've achieved this?"

### Validation & Close (15 min)

**Say:**
"Let's step back and look at our complete Practical Vision.

Questions:
- Is anything major missing?
- Does this feel ambitious but achievable in 3 years?
- Will stakeholders recognize their input here?
- Does this align with our SWOT—leveraging strengths, addressing weaknesses, capturing opportunities?"

**Close:**
"This is excellent work. I'll compile this into our Practical Vision document. You'll receive it for review.

Next session: Underlying Contradictions—what tensions must we resolve to make this vision real?"

- What professional growth exists?
- How do people collaborate?

**Community & Families:**
- How do families engage with schools?
- What partnerships exist?
- How is the district perceived?

**Technology & Innovation:**
- How is technology used for learning?
- What innovations are happening?
- How is data used?

**Facilities & Resources:**
- What do learning spaces look like?
- How are resources allocated?
- What infrastructure exists?

**Safety & Wellness:**
- How do students/staff feel at school?
- What supports exist for wellness?
- How is climate measured?

**Fiscal & Operations:**
- How are resources used efficiently?
- What fiscal health exists?
- How are operations supporting learning?

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Ideas too vague | "Make it observable. What would I see?" |
| Ideas too small | "Think bigger. What's the vision, not the task?" |
| Getting stuck | Offer prompts by category |
| Too many clusters | "Can any of these combine? What's the broader theme?" |
| Disagreement on categories | "Both can be true. Let's capture the nuance." |
| Dominant contributors | "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken." |

---
