# Strategic Planning Retreat
## Condensed 1-Day Agenda

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Complete core strategic planning elements in a focused one-day format.

**Pre-Requisite:**
- Phase 1 Discovery complete
- Draft SWOT pre-reviewed by participants
- Initial vision brainstorm completed as pre-work

**Participants:** 15-25 planning team members.

**Outcomes by End of Day:**

**Trade-offs:** This condensed format sacrifices depth for efficiency. Implementation planning will require a follow-up session.

## Session Details

### 8:45 - Discovery Highlights (15 min)

**Focus on:**
- Top 3 strengths (evidence-based)
- Top 3 areas for improvement
- 2-3 key themes from stakeholder input
- 1-2 powerful quotes

**Skip:**
- Detailed methodology
- Full data presentation
- Deep dives into any area

**Say:**
"You have the full report. Here are the highlights that should inform today's work..."

### 9:00 - SWOT Quick Validation (30 min)

**Condensed approach:**
- Tables have draft SWOT
- 5 min per quadrant (not 10)
- Focus on: Add anything missing, flag anything wrong, star top 3
- No deep discussion—that happened in pre-work

**Timing:**
- Strengths: 5 min
- Weaknesses: 5 min
- Opportunities: 5 min
- Threats: 5 min
- Cross-check and finalize: 10 min

### 9:30 - SWOT Synthesis (20 min)

**Fast approach:**
- Each table calls out their top 2 per quadrant (not full list)
- Facilitator captures on flip chart
- Dot vote immediately: 3 dots per person per quadrant
- Identify top 5 per quadrant

### 9:50 - Investment & Barriers (15 min)

**Quick version:**
- "What 3 Strength × Opportunity investments should we prioritize?"
- "What 3 Weaknesses most threaten our ability to succeed?"
- Tables discuss 5 min, report 1-2 each

### 10:30 - Vision Sharing (15 min)

**Because pre-work was done:**
- Tables share pre-work sticky notes
- Quickly group similar ideas
- Identify table's top 10-12 to post

### 10:45 - Wall Posting & Clustering (25 min)

**Condensed:**
- Post all at once (5 min)
- Silent clustering (10 min)
- Discussion clustering (10 min)

### 11:10 - Naming Vision Categories (20 min)

**Aim for 6-8 categories (not 8-10)**
- Combine where possible
- Quick name generation
- Don't over-perfect

### 1:05 - Rapid Contradiction Brainstorm (15 min)

**Frame tightly:**
- "Given our vision, what tensions exist?"
- "We want X, BUT Y"
- Individual: 5 min
- Table share: 10 min

### 1:35 - Contradiction Clustering & Naming (20 min)

**Fast approach:**
- Post table top 3s on wall
- Quick cluster by similarity
- Name clusters immediately
- Aim for 5-7 contradictions (not 8-12)

### 2:30 - Direction Brainstorm (20 min)

**Assign:**
- Each table gets 1-2 contradictions
- Brainstorm approaches that resolve them
- Identify 1-2 strongest direction ideas

### 2:50 - Direction Development (30 min)

**Simplified template:**
```
DIRECTION NAME:

Statement (1-2 sentences):

Resolves Contradiction(s):

Advances Vision Categories:

3 Key Strategies:
1.
2.
3.

Resource Level: Low / Medium / High
```

### 3:20 - Quick Share (20 min)

**2 min per direction:**
- Read name and statement
- Which contradiction does it resolve?
- Any quick clarifying questions (not debate)

### 3:55 - Implementation Preview (10 min)

**Set up follow-up session:**
- Show three-column framework
- Explain what will happen in next session
- This is NOT done today

**Say:**
"We've done the strategic thinking. Implementation planning—the specifics of what, when, who—will happen in our follow-up session. Today we've built the foundation."

### 4:05 - Next Steps (15 min)

**Clarify:**
1. Facilitator compiles outputs this week
2. Participants review within [timeframe]
3. Follow-up session scheduled for implementation
4. Board presentation date
5. Launch timeline

**Commitment round:**
"What's your commitment to this process going forward?"

## What Gets Cut

Compared to 2-day retreat, this 1-day format sacrifices:

| Element | 2-Day | 1-Day | Impact |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| SWOT depth | 2.5 hrs | 1.25 hrs | Less refinement |
| Vision development | 3+ hrs | 2 hrs | Less narrative |
| Contradiction analysis | 2.5 hrs | 1.25 hrs | Fewer identified |
| Direction refinement | 2+ hrs | 1.5 hrs | Less polished |
| Implementation planning | 2+ hrs | 0 hrs | Requires follow-up |
| Cross-integration | Multiple | Minimal | Less synthesis |
| Breaks/networking | Ample | Minimal | More fatigue |

---

## Mitigating Strategies

### For Less Depth

- Rely heavily on pre-work
- Prioritize ruthlessly (do 5 things well, not 10 poorly)
- Accept "draft" quality; refine later
- Capture parking lot items for follow-up

### For Energy Management

- Keep sessions short (max 30 min per activity)
- Lots of movement (posting, gallery walks)
- Energizers after lunch critical
- End by 4:30 (cognitive fatigue real)

### For Implementation Gap

- Schedule follow-up within 2 weeks
- Assign direction leads to do pre-work
- Have them draft three-column before next session

---

## Follow-Up Session Requirements

**Schedule within 2 weeks.**

**Duration:** 2-3 hours

**Focus:**
- Three-column development per direction
- Success indicators
- Year 1 quarterly timeline
- Ownership assignments

**Who attends:**
- Direction leads (mandatory)
- Cabinet members
- Key implementers

---

## Materials (Condensed)

### Per Table
- 30 large sticky notes
- 8 markers
- 20 small sticky notes
- 1 roll tape
- 6 templates (simplified)

### Room
- 15 sheets chart paper
- 150 dot stickers
- Visible timer
- Projector
