# Strategic Planning Retreat
## Condensed 1-Day Agenda

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Complete Stages 1-3 of strategic planning in a focused one-day format.

**Pre-Requisite:**
- Stage 1 Discovery data collection complete
- Draft SWOT pre-reviewed by participants
- Initial vision brainstorm completed as pre-work

**Participants:** 15-25 planning team members.

**Outcomes by End of Day:**
- Validated SWOT with priorities (Stage 1 completion)
- Mission/Vision/Values reaffirmed, priority areas defined (Stage 2)
- Draft Strategic Directions (Stage 2)
- Next steps for implementation planning (Stage 3 prep)

**Trade-offs:** This condensed format sacrifices depth for efficiency. Stage 3 (implementation planning) and Stage 4 (monitoring) require follow-up sessions.

## Pre-Retreat Requirements

### Critical Pre-Work (Required)

**2 weeks before — Send to all participants:**

1. **Discovery Report Summary** (2-3 pages)
2. **Draft SWOT** for review with instructions: "Review and come prepared to add/edit"
3. **Vision Pre-Work Assignment:** "Write 5-10 ideas completing: 'In 3 years, I see...' — Bring your ideas on sticky notes"

### 1 Week Before

- [ ] Confirm pre-work completion
- [ ] Prepare condensed materials
- [ ] Assign table groups (mixed stakeholders)
- [ ] Confirm venue and catering

> **Optional deeper work:** If time allows or the organization wants richer input, the afternoon can incorporate elements from Appendix A (Deep Vision Development) or Appendix B (Organizational Tension Analysis). These would require extending the day by 1-2 hours or moving them to a pre-retreat session. For Appendix C (Profile of a Graduate), this is a multi-session process and is better suited as pre-retreat or parallel work rather than a condensed-day add-on.

## Session Details

### 8:45 - Discovery Highlights (15 min)

**Focus on:**
- Top 3 strengths (evidence-based)
- Top 3 areas for improvement
- 2-3 key themes from stakeholder input
- 1-2 powerful quotes

**Skip:** Detailed methodology, full data presentation, deep dives

**Say:** "You have the full report. Here are the highlights that should inform today's work..."

### 9:00 - SWOT Quick Validation (30 min)

**Condensed approach:**
- Tables have draft SWOT
- 5 min per quadrant (not 10)
- Focus on: Add anything missing, flag anything wrong, star top 3
- No deep discussion—that happened in pre-work

### 9:30 - SWOT Synthesis (20 min)

**Fast approach:**
- Each table calls out top 2 per quadrant (not full list)
- Facilitator captures on flip chart
- Dot vote immediately: 3 dots per person per quadrant
- Identify top 5 per quadrant

### 9:50 - Investment & Barriers (15 min)

**Quick version:**
- "What 3 Strength × Opportunity investments should we prioritize?"
- "What 3 Weaknesses most threaten our ability to succeed?"
- Tables discuss 5 min, report 1-2 each

### 10:20 - Mission/Vision/Values (20 min)

**Condensed approach:**
- If existing statements: Quick reaffirmation. "Do these still represent us? Any changes?"
- If new: Table drafts, quick synthesis, accept "good enough for now" language

### 10:40 - Priority Areas (20 min)

- Individual brainstorm (5 min)
- Table consolidation (5 min)
- Large group: post, cluster, name 3-6 areas (10 min)

### 11:25 - Direction Brainstorm (20 min)

- Focus on priority areas and SWOT barriers
- Each table brainstorms innovative approaches
- Identify 1-2 strongest direction ideas per table

### 12:50 - Direction Development (35 min)

**Simplified template:**
```
DIRECTION NAME:

Statement (1-2 sentences):

Priority Areas Served:

3 Key Strategies:
1.
2.
3.

Resource Level: Low / Medium / High
```

### 1:25 - Quick Share (20 min)

**2 min per direction:**
- Read name and statement
- Which priority areas does it serve?
- Quick clarifying questions only (not debate)

### 2:15 - Implementation Preview (15 min)

**Set up follow-up session:**
- Show three-column framework
- Explain what will happen in the next session
- Detailed implementation planning is NOT done today

**Say:**
"We've done the strategic thinking. Implementation planning—the specifics of what, when, who—will happen in our follow-up session. Today we've built the foundation."

### 3:05 - Next Steps (15 min)

**Clarify:**
1. Facilitator compiles outputs this week
2. Participants review within [timeframe]
3. Follow-up session scheduled for Stage 3 implementation planning
4. Board presentation date
5. Launch timeline

## What Gets Cut

Compared to 2-day retreat, this 1-day format sacrifices:

| Element | 2-Day | 1-Day | Impact |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| SWOT depth | 2.5 hrs | 1.25 hrs | Less refinement |
| Vision/Direction development | 3+ hrs | 2.5 hrs | Less polished |
| Implementation planning | 2+ hrs | Preview only | Requires follow-up |
| Cross-integration | Multiple | Minimal | Less synthesis |
| Breaks/networking | Ample | Minimal | More fatigue |
| Monitoring planning | Introduced | Not covered | Follow-up needed |

---

## Mitigating Strategies

### For Less Depth
- Rely heavily on pre-work
- Prioritize ruthlessly (do 5 things well, not 10 poorly)
- Accept "draft" quality; refine later
- Capture parking lot items for follow-up

### For Energy Management
- Keep sessions short (max 35 min per activity)
- Movement (posting, gallery walks)
- Energizers after lunch critical
- End by 3:45 (cognitive fatigue real)

### For Implementation Gap
- Schedule follow-up within 2 weeks
- Assign direction leads to do pre-work
- Have them draft three-column templates before next session

---

## Follow-Up Session Requirements

**Schedule within 2 weeks.**

**Duration:** 3-4 hours

**Focus:**
- Three-column development per direction (Stage 3)
- Success indicators and metrics
- Year 1 quarterly timeline
- Resource alignment
- Ownership assignments
- Monitoring framework introduction (Stage 4)

**Who attends:**
- Direction leads (mandatory)
- Cabinet members
- Key implementers

---

## Materials (Condensed)

- 30 large sticky notes
- 8 markers
- 20 small sticky notes
