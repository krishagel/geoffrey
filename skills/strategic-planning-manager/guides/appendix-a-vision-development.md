# Appendix A: Deep Vision Development
## Participatory Visioning Exercise

---

## When to Use This

Use this appendix when your organization wants **broad participatory engagement** in setting direction. This is a full visioning exercise (3-4 hours) that engages stakeholders in building a concrete picture of what success looks like.

This exercise is referenced from the Stage 2 guide. It can be:
- Run as a standalone session before developing strategic directions
- Incorporated into a 2-day retreat
- Used when a district is developing a vision from scratch (not reaffirming an existing one)

**Skip this if:** The district has a recent, well-supported vision that just needs reaffirmation. In that case, the simplified process in the Stage 2 guide is sufficient.

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Define what success looks like in 3 years through collaborative brainstorming and consensus building.

**Duration:** 3-4 hours for workshop session

**AI Role:** Provide prompts, capture input, suggest groupings
**Human Role:** Primary creators of vision content

---

## Key Principle

A **Practical Vision** is NOT:
- A mission statement
- Vague aspirations
- What we're doing now

A **Practical Vision** IS:
- Concrete, observable outcomes
- What will be different in 3 years
- Stakeholder-focused changes
- Achievable but ambitious

**The Test:** "If I walked into this district in 3 years, what would I see, hear, and experience?"

## Facilitation Script

### Welcome & Context (10 min)

**Say:**
"Today we're building our Practical Vision—a concrete picture of what our district looks like in 3 years if we're successful.

This isn't about what we're doing now, or vague hopes. It's about specific, observable outcomes. Think about:
- What students will experience
- What families will see
- What staff will be doing differently
- What our community will notice

The key question: **It's [year + 3]. You walk into our district. What do you see that makes you proud?**"

### Individual Brainstorm (15 min)

**Say:**
"Take 15 minutes. On your sticky notes, write ONE idea per note. Complete this sentence: 'In 3 years, I see...'

Write as many as you can. Aim for at least 8-10 ideas. They can be about any aspect of the district—learning, climate, staff, community, anything.

Be specific. Not 'good instruction' but 'teachers using data to personalize learning for every student.'

Go."

**Circulate and prompt:**
- "What about students? What will they experience?"
- "What will families notice?"
- "What about staff culture?"
- "Think about equity—what will be different?"

### Pair Share (10 min)

**Say:**
"Turn to a partner. Share your ideas. Look for overlaps and build on each other's thinking. Combine similar ideas onto one note if you'd like."

### Table Consolidation (20 min)

**Say:**
"At your table, share all your ideas. Group similar ones together. As a table, identify your TOP 10-12 ideas to post on the wall.

Write clearly—these will be read from a distance. One idea per note."

### Wall Posting (10 min)

**Say:**
"One person from each table, bring your notes to the wall and post them. Don't organize yet—just post them all in your table's section."

### Break (10 min)

**Say:**
"Take a break. When you come back, walk the wall. Read what other tables wrote. Notice patterns."

### Clustering Round 1 — Silent (15 min)

**Say:**
"Now we cluster. Without talking, move notes that seem related closer together. If you see two ideas that belong together, put them near each other.

Don't create formal categories yet—just cluster by similarity. Work silently for 15 minutes."

### Clustering Round 2 — Discussion (20 min)

**Say:**
"Now you can talk. Discuss the clusters you see forming. Continue to refine groupings. What themes are emerging?"

**Aim for 8-10 distinct categories.**

**Facilitate:**
- "Is this one cluster or two?"
- "Where does this note belong?"
- "What's the common thread in this cluster?"
- "Are there any gaps—something nobody mentioned?"

### Naming Categories (25 min)

**Say:**
"Now we name each cluster. The name should capture the essence of what's in that column.

Not just 'Technology' but 'Technology That Empowers Learning'
Not just 'Staff' but 'Supported, Growing Professionals'

Work in pairs or small groups—each pair takes 2-3 columns. Write a name on the header card."

**Large group review each name:**
- "Does this name capture what's here?"
- "Is it aspirational enough?"
- "Is it too vague?"

### Vision Narrative Development (20 min)

**Say:**
"For each category, let's create a 2-3 sentence narrative. What's the story of this vision area?

I'll capture these as we discuss. Let's start with [first category]..."

**For each category, ask:**
- "In plain language, what does this mean for our district?"
- "What will people experience?"
- "How will we know we've achieved this?"

### Validation & Close (15 min)

**Say:**
"Let's step back and look at our complete Practical Vision.

Questions:
- Is anything major missing?
- Does this feel ambitious but achievable in 3 years?
- Will stakeholders recognize their input here?
- Does this align with our SWOT—leveraging strengths, addressing weaknesses, capturing opportunities?"

**Close:**
"This is strong work. I'll compile this into our Practical Vision document. You'll receive it for review.

This vision will guide Stage 2's strategic directions and the entire plan."

## Vision Categories Common in K-12

Use as prompts if groups need direction:

| Category | Prompt Questions |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Learning & Achievement** | What does student learning look like? How are students prepared? |
| **Equity & Access** | Who is succeeding? What barriers are removed? |
| **Staff & Culture** | How do staff describe their work? What growth exists? |
| **Community & Families** | How do families engage? What partnerships exist? |
| **Technology & Innovation** | How is technology used? What innovations are happening? |
| **Facilities & Resources** | What do learning spaces look like? How are resources allocated? |
| **Safety & Wellness** | How do students/staff feel? What supports exist? |
| **Fiscal & Operations** | How are resources used efficiently? What fiscal health exists? |

---

## Vision Matrix Format

The final output should look like:

| Category 1 | Category 2 | Category 3 | Category 4 | ... |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|-----|
| Vision item | Vision item | Vision item | Vision item | ... |
| Vision item | Vision item | Vision item | Vision item | ... |
| Vision item | Vision item | Vision item | Vision item | ... |

With a narrative paragraph for each category.

---

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Ideas too vague | "Make it observable. What would I see?" |
| Ideas too small | "Think bigger. What's the vision, not the task?" |
| Getting stuck | Offer prompts by category (see table above) |
| Too many clusters | "Can any of these combine? What's the broader theme?" |
| Disagreement on categories | "Both can be true. Let's capture the nuance." |
| Dominant contributors | "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken." |

---
